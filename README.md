### Luke Hinds

I am software engineer working mostly on open source security projects. I have lots of experience bootstrapping projects from new and helping grow diverse, inclusive and friendly ðŸ‘¯ communitees.

I founded [project sigstore](https://sigstore.dev) and developed the [keyline project](https://keylime.dev) alongside MIT lincoln labs.

I also do a fair number of gigs around open source security in general.

* I am member of the [kubernetes security response team](https://github.com/kubernetes/committee-security-response/blob/main/README.md#security-response-committee-src), where I manage vulnerabilities and the [hackerone bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/kubernetes).
* I an elected member of the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org) Techincal Advisory Council
* I am board member on the [confidential computing consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/)

I am always happy to ðŸ’¬ about software security and growing open source communities.
